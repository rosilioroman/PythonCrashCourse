# *Python Crash Course* Notes
My personal repo of notes as I go through the book "Python Crash Course" by Eric Matthes.

## Get the book 
I'm not affliated in any way with the author or publisher, but you can [check out the book here.](https://nostarch.com/python-crash-course-3rd-edition)

## File Structure
`chapters/`
- Contains "Try It Yourself" exerices and any other chapter-specific files  

`projects/`
- Contains subdirectories for the book's 3 major projects

## Recommended Setup
My only recommendation is to set up an isolated python virtual environment. There are many online resources for learning why it's good practice and how to do so.  
I simply used Python's built-in virtual environment manager [`venv`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) for this purpose.
